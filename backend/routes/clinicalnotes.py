    Run Ollama tinyllama model for NLP disease identification.

    prompt = f"""
You are a medical text classifier specialized in mental health.

Task: Extract mental health disease, risk level, and provide a long, detailed suggestion.

Examples:

Clinical Note: "Patient feels sad, hopeless, avoids social contact."
Output:
Disease Name: Depression
Risk Level: High
Suggestion: The patient exhibits classical signs of depression including sadness, hopelessness, and social withdrawal. Immediate consultation with a psychiatrist is recommended, along with a structured therapy plan and support from family or caregivers. Consider regular counseling sessions, mindfulness practices, and monitoring for any suicidal thoughts or tendencies.

Clinical Note: "Patient is anxious before exams but manages with breathing."
Output:
Disease Name: Anxiety
Risk Level: Low
Suggestion: The patient experiences situational anxiety related to exams but is able to manage it with relaxation techniques. Encourage continued use of deep breathing, mindfulness, and structured study schedules. Consider support groups or counseling for coping strategies if anxiety increases.

Clinical Note: "Patient reports difficulty concentrating, hyperactivity, and impulsive behavior."
Output:
Disease Name: ADHD
Risk Level: Moderate
Suggestion: The patient shows signs of ADHD including hyperactivity, impulsivity, and concentration difficulties. Recommend behavioral therapy, organizational strategies, and potentially consultation with a specialist for medication evaluation. Encourage structured routines and positive reinforcement strategies.

Now analyze the following clinical note:

Clinical Note:
\"\"\"{text}\"\"\" 

Output strictly in the same format. Provide detailed suggestions. Do not output 'N/A'. If unable to determine, give a generic but meaningful suggestion.
